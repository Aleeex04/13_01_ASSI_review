The project consists of creating an equal database in both PostgreSQL and MySQL. In the SQL branch you will be able to see both the ddl of the two databases as well as the different procedures, triggers, cursors, etc... On the other hand, in the Querys-Relational-Algebra branch you will see five examples of queries both in SQL language and in relational algebra.
